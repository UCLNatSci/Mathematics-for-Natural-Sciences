# Series

To do:

- definition of sequence
- limit of sequence
- convergence and divergence and plenty of examples
- definition of series as limit of partial sums

## Notation
```{admonition} Definition
A **series** is the sum of a sequence of terms, written as follows:


```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^n u_i = u_1 + u_2 + \ldots + u_n.
```

The subscript numbering does not have to start from 1. We can also replace the upper value $n$ with $\infty$ for an infinite series.

Character $\Sigma$ is the Greek letter sigma, written in upper case, and is used to mean "sum".


We would read the expression above as "the sum of $u_i$ from $i=1$ to $i=n$".

```{admonition} Practice
:class: tip
Write the following expressions using sigma notation (you do not need to evaluate them).
1. $1+5+9+13+17+21$
1. $64−32+16−8+4−2+1$
1. $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \ldots + \frac{1}{99}$
```
