## Notation: sequences and series

### Sequences

#### Overview

Your intuition of a sequence will likely be correct.
It can mean a sequence of letters, such as a word (e.g. A, U, S, T, R, A, L, I, A) or a DNA sequence 
(e.g. A, T, G, C, G, G, T, C, A, T, C).
It can also be a sequence of numbers such as a telephone number, date of birth, something nonsensical 
(e.g. $181291, 2, -4309, \sqrt{7}$) or the prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots$.
Here, the dots indicate that the sequence goes on infinitely.

Each part of the sequence is called a **term**.
Each sequence has a specific ordering of terms. 
For example, the series $1,2,3,4$ is different from the series $4,3,2,1$ much in the same way that the telephone number 
$18001234$ will reach a different person to the phone number $18004321$.

#### Sequences as numerical patterns

In this course sequences will be [numerical patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV7C7bXm4VI). 
Much of mathematics is concerned with patterns in both mathematical constructs and nature, the study of sequences 
provides a firm grounding for this endeavour.

A famous pattern that arises in many natural systems is the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number): 
$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \dots$.
This sequence is generated by starting with the sequence $0,1$ and finding the next number 
in the sequence by adding the two previous numbers together, e.g. $0+1=\mathbf{1}$, $1+1=\mathbf{2}$, $1+2=\mathbf{3}$, 
$2+3=\mathbf{5}$, $3+5=\mathbf{8}$, etc.


#### Definition

```{admonition} Definition
A **sequence** is a set of terms where order matters, written as follows:

```{math}
    u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n
```
Here, the size of the sequence (the number of terms) is $n$.
The $i$-th term in the sequence is $u_i$ where $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$.
It must be noted that the index notation $i$ is an arbitrarily chosen, one might use other letters such as $j$ or $k$
or even Greek letters such as $\alpha$ or $\sigma$.
It is also conventional to express a series in brackets: $(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$.
As we saw in the previous examples, sequences can have finite $n<\infty$ (e.g. telephone numbers) or infinite sizes 
$n \to \infty$ (e.g. Fibonacci sequence and prime numbers).

#### Expressing a sequence pattern as a formula

It is sometimes possible to express a sequence as a formula, which sets out the rule(s) to find the sequence.
For example, the Fibonacci sequence can be expressed as the formula 
```{math}
u_i=u_{i-1}+u_{i-2}
```
which specifies the $i$-th term provided we have the term for $i-1$ and $i-2$.
It is because of this formula that it is necessary to provide the first two terms of the sequence, $u_1=0$ and $u_2=1$, 
to find the rest of the sequence.
This formula can be used to find the entire, infinite sequence.
For example, the 298-th term is $u_{298} = 84885164052257330097714121751630835360966663883732297726369399$ and
the 299-th term is $u_{299} = 137347080577163115432025771710279131845700275212767467264610201$ and hence the
300-term is is $u_{300} = 222232244629420445529739893461909967206666939096499764990979600$.

Note that the formula $u_i=u_{i-1}+u_{i-2}$ will generate a different sequence to the Fibonacci sequence when the 
starting terms ar different (e.g. $u_1=10$ and $u_2=11$).
For an example, convince yousrelf that the formule $u_i = 2 + u_{i-1}$ provides the sequence of even numbers when
$u_1=2$ and the sequence of odd numbers when $u_1=1$.

As a final example, the formula $u_i = 2 + 3 \times (i-2)$ generates the infinite sequence: $-1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, \dots$.
Note that it is not necessary to provide the first term in the sequence because the formula does not depend on the previous
term(s) in the sequence.
Also notice that the sequence grows without bound.
That is, each term is larger than each of the previous terms.
In this way the sequence grows to an infinite value as $i$ tends to infinity.





### Series

Series play a central role in calculus and are the main reason why we introduce sequences in the section above.

#### Definition

Series are simply defined by the sum of a sequence.
```{admonition} Definition
A **series** is the sum of a sequence of terms, written as follows:


```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^n u_i = u_1 + u_2 + \ldots + u_n.
```
The subscript numbering does not have to start from 1. 
We can also replace the upper value $n$ with $\infty$ for an infinite series.
For example, the series of the infinite sequence $(u_1,u_2,u_3,\dots)$ is $\sum_{i=1}^\infty u_i$.

#### Summations

Character $\Sigma$ is the Greek letter sigma, written in upper case, and is used to mean "sum".
We would read the expression above as "the sum of $u_i$ from $i=1$ to $i=n$".
For example the sum of $i$ from $i=1$ to $i=4$ is $\sum_{i=1}^4 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$ and the sum of $2 i$ from 
$i=1$ to $i=4$ is $\sum_{i=1}^4 2 i = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20$.
From this example it should be clear that, in general:
```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^n a u_i = a \sum_{i=1}^n u_i
``` 
where $a$ is a constant number and $u_i$ is a function of $i$ (i.e. a number that changes with the value of $i$).
We note that $\sum_{i=1}^n a + u_i$ does not equal ($\ne$) to $a + \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$. 
For example, $\sum_{i=1}^4 1+i = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14$.



### Questions





## Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions

We now introduce the arithmetic progression (otherwise known as the arithmetic sequence) and the geometric progression 
(otherwise known as the geometric sequence).
These sequences have the nice property that their series can be solved.

### Arithmetic progression 

#### Definition

```{admonition} Arithmetic Progression
An arithmetic progression (otherwise known as an arithmetic sequence) is a sequence of $n$ terms which all have a "common 
difference" $d$, written as follows: 

```{math} 
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \dots, a + (n-1) d 
```

where $a$ is an arbitrary number.


Using the notation for sequences in the previous section, the $i$-th term of the arithmetic progression is
$u_i=a+(i-1)d$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$.
An example is the sequence $3,5,7,9,11,13$ in which the first term is $a=3$, the common difference is $d=2$ and the 
number of terms is $n=6$.
An infinite arithmetic progression is given by the case where $n \to \infty$.


#### Solving the series of arithmetic progessions

Series of arithmetic progessions can be solved (i.e. reduced to a number).
The series (or the sum) $S_n$ of an arithmetic progression $u_i=a+(i-1)d$ is:
```{math}
 S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i = \sum_{i=1}^n a + (i -1 ) d = \frac{n}{2} \big( 2 a + (n - 1) d \big) = \frac{n}{2} (a + L)
```
where $L = a + (n-1) d$ is the last term in the series.

Notice that as $n$ (the number of terms) increases, the terms of arithmetic progessions grow without bound.
That is, as $n$ approaches $\infty$, the arithmetic progession approaches $\infty$ if $d>0$ and approaches $-\infty$ if 
$d<0$.
In these cases we say that the series diverges (more on this later!). 
Infinite arithmetic progressions always diverge, the proof of which can be found via 
[this link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3334553/proof-that-arithmetic-series-diverges)
(although further reading is required!).

#### Proof of the solution of the series of arithmetic progressions

Fromm the equation foor $S_n$ write down the reversed series below the original:
```{math}
S_n = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + \dots + \Big( a + (n-3) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-2) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-1) d \Big) \\
S_n = a + \Big( a + (n-1) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-2) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-3) d \Big) + \dots + (a+2d) + (a+d) + a \ .
```
Adding these two expressions gives:
```{math}
2 S_n =  \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big) + \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big) + \dots + \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big) \ .
```
Since there are $n$ terms, this equations simplifies to the final result:
```{math}
S_n =  \frac{n}{2} \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big)  \ .
```
[There is a legend](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/gausss-day-of-reckoning), 
that Gauss (a famous mathematician) used a similar approach as a schoolboy back in the 1780s to find the answer to 
$1+2+\dots+99+100$.

### Geometric Progression 

#### Definition

```{admonition} Geometric Progression
A geometric progression (otherwise known as an geometric sequence) is a sequence of $n$ terms which have "common ratio" 
$r$, written as follows:

```{math}
a, a r, a r^2, a r^3, \dots , a r^{n-1}
```
where $a$ is an arbitrary number.
Using the notation for sequences in the previous section, the $i$-th term of the geometric progression is
$u_i=a r^{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$.
In other words, the next term in the geometric progression can be found by multiplying the previous term by the common
ratio $r$, given by the formula $u_i = r u_{i-1}$ where $u_1=a$.
An example is the sequence $24,−12,6,−3,1.5$ in which the first term is $a=2$, the common ratio is $r=−\frac{1}{2}$ and 
the number of terms is $n=5$.

#### Solving the series of geometriic progessions

Like arithmetic progessions, the series of geometric progressions can be solved (i.e. reduced to a number).
The series (or the sum) $S_n$ of a geometric progression $u_i=a r^{i-1}$ is:
```{math}
 S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i = a r^{i -1} = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1-r} 
```

#### Proof of the solution of the series of geometric progressions

Starting from the the definition of the series:
```{math}
S_n = a + a r + a r^2 + \dots + a r^{n-3} + a r^{n-2} + a r^{n-1} = a \Big(1 + r + r^2 + \dots + r^{n-3} + r^{n-2} + 
r^{n-1} \big) \ ,
```
we multiply by $r$:
```{math}
r S_n = a \Big(r + r^2 + r^2 + \dots + r^{n-2} + r^{n-1} + r^{n} \big) \ .
```
Subtracting $r S_n$ from $S_n$ and cancelling the terms provides:
```{math}
 S_n - r S_n = a \Big(1 - r^{n} \big) \ ,
```
which can be rearranged to provide the result.



#### A preliminary introduction to convergence and divergence

The behaviour of a geometric progression for "large" numbers of terms $n$ depends on the value of the common ratio $r$.
This can be deduced by the following reasoning.
If $r > 1$ or $r < -1$ (which is to say that the absolute value $\lvert r \rvert < 1$) then the $i$-th term of the
geometric progression $u_i=a r^{i-1}$ becomes a very large positive or negative number.
In this case we say that the series **diverges**.
Conversely, if $\lvert r \rvert < 1$  then $u_i=a r^{i-1}$ becomes a very small positive or negative number.
In this case we say that the series **converges**.
Thus we conclude that
* if $\lvert r \rvert < 1$ then $S_n$ converges and approaches $\frac{a}{1-r}$ as $n\to \infty$,
* if $\lvert r \rvert > 1$ then $S_n$ diverges and approaches $\infty$ as $n\to \infty$.

### Questions







## Binomial Expansion

Throughout your scientific journey you will likely come across a time where you have to solve an equation like $(x+y)^n$.
We will know describe how you go about such a task and will highlight some interesting mathematical relations.

#### Definition of a binomial

Polynomials are expressions such as $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3$ where $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ are the
polynomial coefficients and $x$ is the variable.
They can have multiple variables (e.g. $x$ and $y$) such as $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x y + a_3 x y^2$. 
A binomial is a polynomial with two terms (e.g. x + y, x^3 + 1,  4.3 x^5 - 2.2 y, etc).
Binomial expansion refers to the computation of powers of binomials:
```{math}
(x+y)^n
```
where $n$ is a real number.
This is a general way to express a binomial expansion - the expansion of more complicated binomials can be "swapped in" 
for the $x$ and $y$ (e.g. $x\to 10 x^3$ and $y \to \sqrt{17}$).
In this section we will investigate the binomial expansion only for the case where $n$ is a noon-negative integer 
(e.g. $n=0,1,2,3,\dots$).


### The binomial formula

We now set out to calculate the polynomials produced by the expansion of powers of a binomial.

#### Expanding low powers of binomials by hand

It is possible to expand low powers of binomials (i.e. $n=0,1,2,3,4,5$) by hand:
```{math}
(x+y)^0 &= 1 \ , \\
(x+y)^1 &= x+y \ , \\
(x+y)^2 &= (x+y)(x+y) = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2 \ , \\
(x+y)^3 &= (x+y) (x+y)^2 = x^3 + 3 x^2 y + 2 x y^2 + y^3 \ , \\ 
(x+y)^4 &= (x+y) (x+y)^3 = x^4 + 4 x^3 y + 6 x^2 y^2 + 4 x y^3 + y^4 \ , \\ 
(x+5)^5 &= (x+y) (x+y)^4 = x^5 + 5 x^4 y + 10 x^3 y^2 + 10 x^2 y^3 + 5 x y^4 + y^5 \ .
```
You can see symmetry and patterns in the polynomials on the right hand side of the expansions.
For instance, the combined powers of the $x$'s and $y$'s are equal to the power of expansion $n$ and the total number
of terms is $n+1$.
But what is the pattern for the coefficients?
The answer to this is not trivial and is a fundamental sequence of numbers - the binomial coefficients.

#### The binomial coefficient

```{admonition} The binomial coefficient
     
```{math}
 \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n - k)!} \ .
```
Like the number $\pi$, the binomial coefficient pops up in many unexpected places - particularly in counting problems
(the bread-and-butter of the field of combinatorics).
For example, these numbers were first described in tenth century by Indian mathematician 
[Halayuddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halayudha).
An ancient way (first discovers in China in 11th century) of calculating the binomial coefficients can be found using 
[Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_trianglehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle).
The binomial coefficient is the number of ways, disregarding order, that $k$ objects can be chosen from $n$ objects.
This number $\binom{n}{k}$ can be casually referred to as "n choose k", and can be expressed by $C^n_k$ $and hence 
calculators encode the binomial coefficient by the "nCk" button.

#### Factorials

We breifly note that the "$!$" symbol represents a factorial of an integer number.
A factorial of integer number $n$ is defined as the product of all the numbers from $1$ to $n$: 
$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1$.
The special cases of factorials are $0! =1$ and $1!=1$.
The special cases of the binomial coefficient are thus $\binom{n}{0}= 1$, $\binom{n}{1} = n$, $\binom{n}{n}=1$ and 
$\binom{n}{n-1} = n$.
These examples highlight a nice symmetrical property of the binomial coefficient: $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$ (where
$0 \le k \le n$).

#### Statement of the binomial formula

Knowing the binomial coeffient allows us to find the solution to $(x + y)^n$ for all positive integers $n=0,1,2,\dots$.
With much ado the binomial formula is as follows.
```{admonition} The binomial formula
    
```{math}
 (x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k} =  \binom{n}{0} x^0 y^n +  \binom{n}{1} x^1 y^{n-1} + \dots +
 \binom{n}{n-1} x^{n-1} y^{1} + \binom{n}{n} x^n y^0 \ .
```
You are not required to be familiar with 
[the details of its derivation](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/119480/derivation-of-binomial-coefficient-in-binomial-theorem) 
but do need to be able to apply the formula to compute binomial expansions.
This formula also shows you why $ \binom{n}{k}$ are called binomial coefficients - because they are the coefficients of
the polynomial produce by the expansion of powers of binomials.
Reassure yourself of the utility of this formula by timing yourself expanding $(x+y)^6$ by hand and then by the binomial 
formula.
For further reading you may like to explore the [multinomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_theorem)
which is a generalisation of the binomial formula to polynomials.





## Limits

The mathematics of limits is used to describe the behaviour of a function or sequence that is not AT a point, 
but approaching it. 
For example, in the geometric progression we saw that the sequence approaches either a finite number (converges) or
infinite number (diverges) as the number of terms appraoches infinity.
In what comes next, we will be interested in calculating the "limit" of (i) the terms in a sequence $u_k$ as 
$k \to \infty$, and (ii) the value of a function $f(x)$ as $x \to c$ where $c$ can be a finite or infinite number.
We may distinguish the cases where:
* the function and terms in a sequence **diverge** to an infinite value (blow up to $\pm \infty$),
* the function and terms in a sequence **converge** to a finite value.




### Limits of functions

The limits of a function are best illustrated by example.


#### Example 1

We start with a trivial example, by considering the function $f(x) = x^2$ near to the point (2,4). 
```{figure} x_squared.png
---
name: x_squared
---
A plot of $f(x)=x^2$ together with the point $(2,4)$.
```
In this example, it is apparent that we can trace along the $x^2$ curve towards the point, from either direction. 
Mathematically, we say that we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily close ("as close as you like") to 4 by making $x$ 
sufficiently close to 2. 
We write 
```{math}
\lim_{x \to 2} x^2 = 4
```
and we say that " the limit of $x^2$ as $x$ tends to (approaches) 2 is equal to 4".
In fact, for the squared function, it is clear that 
```{math}
\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)
```
for all $c$, but we will see that this behaviour does not apply for all functions.

We may also consider the limit of a function $f(x)$ as its argument $x$ becomes "very large". 
For instance, we can say that $\lim_{x\to\infty} x^2 = \infty$ since $x^2$ can be made arbitrarily large by making $x$ 
"big enough". 
For instance, we can make $x^2$ larger than 10^{998} by making $x$ larger than 10^{499}.

We would read the expression by saying: "the limit of $x^2$ as $x$ tends to infinity is infinity", though it does not 
actually reach infinity.


#### Example 2

Whilst the limit of $x^2$ for large $x$ is non-finite, there are other functions which approach a finite value as 
$x \to \infty$, and also functions which approach a non-finite value whilst $x$ remains finite. 
For example, consider the behaviour of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, illustrated in the plot below. 
```{figure} reciprocal_x.png
---
name: reciprocal_x
---
A plot of $f(x)= \frac{1}{x}$.
```
In this case, as $x$ becomes very large, $f(x)$ approaches zero.
We write that
```{math}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x}&= 0^+ \\
\lim_{x \to - \infty} \frac{1}{x}&= 0^- \ .
```
The $0^+$ and $0^−$ have been used here to indicate that the function "tends to zero from above/below" as $x$ tends to 
positive and negative infinity respectively.

Near to $x=0$, the behaviour of $\frac{1}{x}$ is different to what we have seen so far:
* As $x$ tends to zero from above (from the right), the graph shoots off to positive infinity, but...
* As $x$ tends to zero from below (from the left), the graph shoot off to negative infinity.

#### The one-sided limit

The previous example motivates the idea of a [one-sided limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-sided_limit).
We write that
```{math}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} &= + \infty \\
\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} &= - \infty \ .
```
Since the left- and right- limits are not the same, then we cannot meaningfully refer to "the limit" without providing 
a direction, so the result for $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x}$ is undefined. 
We say that the function is discontinuous at $x = 0$, though it is 
"[piecewise continuous](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1968943/whats-the-difference-between-continuous-and-piecewise-continuous-functions)" 
on each of the pieces either side of $x=0$.

Another example of a piecewise continous function is the Heaviside function, which we define as:
```{math}
H(x) = \begin{cases}
1 \ \ &\text{if} \ \ \ x > 0 \\
0 \ \ &\text{if} \ \ \ x < 0 
\end{cases}
```
A plot of this function is shown below. It has a finite jump discontinuity at $x=0$.
```{figure} heaviside.png
---
name: heaviside
---
A plot of the Heaviside function $H(x)$.
```


### Limits of sequences



The limit of a sequence is the value that the terms of a sequence approaches (or tends to) as the number of terms 
approaches infinity, written as $k \to \infty$ if $k$ were the index variable.
```{admonition} The limit of a sequence
For a sequence $(u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots)$, the limit of a sequence is written as   
```{math}
 \lim_{k \to \infty} u_k \ .
```
We say that a number, say $U$, is the limit of a the sequence $(u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots)$ if the numbers of the sequence
$u_k$ approach $U$ as $k\to\infty$.
We say that the limit of the sequence diverges if $\lvert U \rvert =\infty$ and converges if $\lvert U \rvert < \infty$.

It is important to note that similarity between the limits of a sequence and a function.
A function $f(x)$ for real number $x$ will have the same limit as the sequence $u_k = f(k)$ for integer number $k$.
For example $f(x) = x^2$, the limit $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty$ is the same as the limit (infinite) of the 
sequence with terms $u_k = k^2$, $(1, 2, 4, 16, \dots).

The key difference is that when we refer to the limit of a sequence we always mean the limit of the terms $u_k$ as the
numbers of terms go to infinity $k\to\infty$.
This is not the case for the limit of functions where the variable (i.e. $x$) can go to any number.

Consider another example from the previous section, the limit of the infinite sequence with terms 
$u_k = \frac{1}{k}$ for $k=1,2,\dots$:
```{math}
1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \dots 
```
is $0$ in the same way that $\lim{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{x} = \infty$.





### Combinaton of limits


It is useful to know how to solve the limit of combinations of functions (or so called functions of functions) such as
```{math}
&\lim_{x \to c} \Big( f(x) + g(x) \Big) \\
&\lim_{x \to c} f(x) g(x)  \\
&\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \ ,
```
where $c$ will can be any number such as $0$, $1$ or $\infty$.

The approach we take to solve these depends on whether the limits of the inidividual functions $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ 
and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ are finite or infinite.

#### Functions that tend to finite values: the combination theorem for limits

First consider the case where the limit of all the functions are finite.
If and only if the limits of the individual functions are FINITE then we can use the combination theorem to solve the combination
of functions.
```{admonition} The combination theorem for limits
If the limits $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)$  are **finite** then, 
```{math}
 &\lim_{x \to c} \Big( \alpha f(x) + \beta g(x) \Big) = \alpha \lim_{x \to c} f(x) + \beta \lim_{x \to c} g(x) \ ,\\
&\lim_{x \to c} f(x) g(x) = \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \lim_{x \to c} g(x) \ ,  \\
&\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \ ,
```
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants.
To stress the point again, the combination theorem for limits can only be used if the limit of every function is finite.

As an example, consider the function:
```{math}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^2}{(x+1)^3 - (x-1)^3} \ . 
```
Since the limits of each of the individual functions are finite: $\lim_{x \to 0} x^2 = 0$, $\lim_{x \to 0} (x+1)^3 = 1$ 
and $\lim_{x \to 0} (x-1)^3 = -1$, we can use first and third statment of the combination theorem to rewrite and solve
the equation as:
```{math}
 \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^2}{(x+1)^3 - (x-1)^3} &= \frac{\lim_{x \to 0} x^2}{\lim_{x \to 0} \Big((x+1)^3 - (x-1)^3}\\
 &= \frac{\lim_{x \to 0} x^2}{\lim_{x \to 0} (x+1)^3 - \lim_{x \to 0}(x-1)^3}\\
 & = \frac{0}{1 - (-1)} \\
 & = \frac{0}{2} \\
 & = 0
```
So we can conclude the limit of the function is $0$.


#### Functions that to to infinite values

We now consider the case where the limit of all the individual functions are infinite, such as
$\lim_{x\to \infty} x^2 = \infty$ and $\lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty$.

The approach we take can be illustrated by the followinig two examples:

##### Example 1

```{math}
 \lim_{x \to \infty} ( x^2 - x ) \ . 
```
This limit appears to "go like" $\infty - \infty$, so you would be forgiven for thinking this result is zero.
On the other hand, there is a sense in which $x^2$ is "much bigger" than $x$ and so it dominates this expression. 
That is $x^2$ "blows up faster" than $x$ as $x\to \infty$.
Indeed, if you try subsitute a large value of $x$ into the function $(x^2 - x)$ you may infer that function can get 
arbitrarily large by making $x$ sufficiently large.
So this limit appears to be infinity.

Another way to approach this problem is to factorise $(x^2 - x) = x (x-1)$; both $x \to \infty$ and $x-1 \to \infty$  
as $x\to\infty$.


##### Example 2

```{math}
 \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + \sqrt{x + 2} }{4 x} \ .
```
The second limit "goes like" $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, but the answer is not one.
To solve this limit we consider the behaviour of the numerator and denominator separately.
We note that the function $x$ is "much much" greater than $\sqrt{x + 2}$ for large $x$ (i.e. $x >> \sqrt{x + 2}$) so we 
say that the numerator "goes like" $x$ for large $x$.
The denominator simply "goes like" 4𝑥, so the fraction in the limit "goes like" $ \frac{x}{4 x} = \frac{1}{4}$. 
Again, you may convince yourself of this by taking some large values of $x$ on your calculator - 
though note that your calculator may not be able to handle the ratio if you make the values too large.

Another approach you may take is to simply the function first:
```{math}
 \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x + \sqrt{x + 2} }{4 x} &= \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{x +2 }}{x} }{4} \\
 & = \frac{1 + \sqrt{ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x^2}  }}{4} \ .
```
Because $\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{x} = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2}{x^2} = 0$, we can see we also arrive at the solution
of $\frac{1}{4}$.

As an exercise, convince yourself that the limit:
```{math}
 \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x + \sqrt{x + 2} }{4 x} = \infty \ .
```




##### Summary

From the 2 examples above we illustrate that the solutions can be found be determing the individual function(s) (which
may be constant values) that dominate in the limit.
It most cases it is useful to simply the equation before tackling the limit.

It must be noted that fractions which "go like" $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ do not necessarily approach a finite limit. 
For instance, the result $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x+2}{x^2 - x}$ is equal to zero, since the degree of the denominator 
is larger than the degree of the numerator and it dominates. 
That is, the denomiator "blows up faster" than the numerator.
