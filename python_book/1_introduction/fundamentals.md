# Fundamentals

After completing this chapter you should be able to:

* Perform arithmetic calculations using numbers (BIDMAS)
* Distinguish between integers and floating point values
* Use scientific notation
* Define and work with numeric variables (int or float)

```{attention}
Do the exercises in the notebook file `week1_python_fundamentals.ipynb` which is in the `week1` folder of your Cocalc Project.
```

## Arithmetic expressions

We can use Python like a scientific calculator to evaluate a mathematical expression, such as 45 times 99. When you run the code, Python evaluates the expression and displays the result underneath the code cell:

```{code-cell} ipython3
45 * 99
```

Python supports the following arithmetic operations:

| Operator | Symbol |
|---|---|
| Addition | `+` |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Multiplication | `*` |
| Division | `/` |
| Power | `**` |




 The order of operations is determined by [BIDMAS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/znmtsbk/articles/zj29dxs). For example, in the following expression, the division is performed first and then the addition, so the result is $3 + \frac{4}{2} = 5$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
3 + 4 / 2
```

+++

Brackets can be used to control the order in which the parts of an expression are computed. For example, to compute $\frac{3 + 4}{2}$ we use brackets so that the addition is carried out first:

```{code-cell} ipython3
(3 + 4) / 2
```

Note that to calculate powers, use the `**` operator, not "^". For example, the following expression gives $8^3$

```{code-cell} ipython3
8 ** 3
```

+++

## Number types

Every Python variable has a **data type** as well as a value. Python understandings two important number types, which are:

* **integers** (whole numbers) 
* **floating point numbers** (decimal values)

When we specify a number in code it is important to understand which type we are creating. If the number inclues a `.` then Python always creates a float, otherwise an integer.

```{code}
5     #this is an integer
5.    #this is a float
```

We often use [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) to represent numbers which are very large or very small. For example, we might write 1.2 million as

$$1.2 \times 10^6$$

where $1.2$ is called the **mantissa** and $6$ is called the **exponent**. Python uses an `e` symbol to separate the mantissa and exponent when using scientific notation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
1.2e6
```

<br> 

The table below gives some examples of numbers and their type/description

|Number|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`5`|`integer`|A whole number|
|`-5`|`integer`|A negative integer|
|`0.5`|`float`|A number with decimal part|
|`5.0`|`float`|Including a decimal point always results in type `float`|
|`5e6`|`float`|$5\times10^6$|
|`2.34e-5`|`float`|$2.34\times10^{-5}$|

```{exercise}
Use Python to calculate the value of $\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5^2 - 4}}{2}$.

Hint: $\sqrt{x} = x^{0.5}$.
```

```{code-block} python

```

## Defining variables

A **variable** is a named storage location in the computer's memory so that we can use it later in our computations. We use **assignment** to set the value of a variable:

```{code-cell} ipython3
speed = 35                 #create a new variable named 'speed' and assign the value 35
double_speed = speed * 2   #create new variable named 'double_speed'
```

We can use the `print` function to display the value of a variable. When you run the code cell, Python displays the results below the code cell:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(speed)
print(double_speed)
```

A single print statement can be used to display multiple values. Separate each value by a comma `,` and use double quotes `"` for literal text:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("The value of speed:", speed)
print("The value of double_speed:", double_speed)
```

````{exercise}
Complete the following code so that it prints the **two** solutions to the quadratic equation $x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0$:

```
a = 1
b = 5
c = 4

first_solution = (-b + (b**2 - 4*a*c)**0.5) / (2*a)

print("First Solution:", first_solution)
```
````

````{admonition} Solution
:class: solution, dropdown

```{code-block} python
a = 1
b = 5
c = 4

first_solution = (-b + (b**2 - 4*a*c)**0.5) / (2*a)
secnd_solution = (-b - (b**2 - 4*a*c)**0.5) / (2*a)

print("First Solution:", first_solution)
print("Second Solution:",secnd_solution)
```
````


````{warning}
The assignment operator `=` is not like equality in mathematics. Python has another operator `==` which tests for equality.

The Python assignment operator `=` first evaluates the expression on the right, and then assigns it to the variable on the left. The following is nonsense and will result in an error:

```{code}
5 = x
```

<h4> Variable naming rules</h4>  

* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`

* A variable name cannot start with a number
* Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age` and `AGE` are three different variables)

It is good practice to stick to a naming convention to make your code more readable, maintainable and consistent. Four of the main conventions are:

| Name         | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PascalCase` | Spaces are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised |
| `camelCase`  | The same as PascalCase, but with the first letter in lower case     |
| `snake_case` | All lower case, with spaces replaced by underscores                 |
| `kebab-case` | All lower case, with spaces replaced by dashes                      |

:::{warning}
Beware of accidentally renaming Python keywords. The following is correct Python but a Very Bad Idea because it renames the `print` function, which will result in some unusual errors:

```
print = 5

print(print) # this won't work.
```
:::


+++

<h4> Updating variables </h4>

We can use assignment to change the value of a variable. Take a look at the following example, in which the same variable name appears on both sides of the equals sign:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Original speed:", speed)

speed = speed + 2 # Increase the value of speed by 2

print("New speed:", speed)
```

This is a legal statement because Python first evaluates the expression on the right of the equals sign (`speed + 2`) and *then* places the result into the variable on the left.

````{exercise}

Complete the code below so that it divides `v` by `5` three times, printing its value each time.
```{code}
v = 1000
print("v:", v)
```
````

````{admonition} Solution
:class: solution, dropdown

```{code-block} python
v = 1000
print("v:", v)
v = v / 5
print("v:", v)
v = v / 5
print("v:", v)
v = v / 5
print("v:", v)
```

## Getting Help

`print` is the first of many Python in-built functions that we will study. You can find out more about Python functions by using the `help()` function. Let's learn about the `print` function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(print)
```

For example, from this we can see how to change the default seperator using `sep`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("1", "2", "3", sep="-")
```
